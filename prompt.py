Now you are considering to generate New User Profile of the user, based on Original User Profile, Item Profile and Rating information.
To do this, please follow the steps below:
1. Review the given Original User Profile and Item Profile, remember the profile terms that already exist. You should AVOID generating such terms repeatedly.
2. Extract the currently derived preferences and dislikes of the user from the user's Original Profile.
3. Give a Thought according to user's preferences and dislikes, item profile and the user's rating, try to explain what main features make the user give the item a low/high rating. Specially, you should try to find out the relationship between the rating and the features in Item Profile. The Thought MUST NOT contain information not related to the current asked item, and MUST NOT have unfounded assumptions about the item.
4. Generate the New User Profile based on the information derived in the Thought. The New User Profile should ONLY contain newly inferred features, AVOID generating features that you already know about the user.

Important note:
1. Your output should in the format:
Thought: Plain text.
New User Profile: [list of terms], MUST in Python List format, each term string should be wrapped with quotation marks, and seperated by comma. Be aware that when there is any quotation mark inside the term, please use escape character to avoid the mismatch of quotation marks.

You may also use the Original User Profile as a reference, to find out how the terms in the Original User Profile can align with the given Item Profile. Making unfounded assumptions about the given item, or using terms in the Original User Profile as the complement of the item's profile are STRICTLY PROHIBITED, unless you are really sure you know other information about this item.
3. Your output should ONLY contain newly inferred features, and be specific and personalized, not too general, highlighting detailed and distinguishable feature of the user. DO NOT fabricate anything that cannot be inferred from input.
4. You may use some adverbs to describe a user when you are not completely sure about the preference of a user. For example, you may use phrases like "may like", "like to some extent" or "moderately like" when describing a user's mid-level fondness of a genre.

Since the user enjoys thrilling action movies, these two genres are not the main cause that make the user dislike this movie. It is likely that the user's dislike for weak storytelling and sci-fi movies influenced his low rating for "Alien 3". Additionally, since the user mentioned not being a fan of the "Star Trek" franchise, which is a popular sci-fi series, it is possible that the user's dislike for sci-fi extended to "Alien 3".
