# UP4LLM

Below are the datasets and Python source codes of our framework, UP4LLM.

Descriptions of this repo will be edited later. By now, we just want to show that our work is solid, repeatable and credible.

All information related to authors are anonymized. 

We use an open-source recommendation framework, RecBole, and conduct multiple revisions based on it to adapt it to our work. The names inside the framework are left as they are, and has nothing to do with the authors of our work.
